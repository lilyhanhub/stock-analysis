# Stock Analysis with Excel VBA

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to refactor the VBA script that I prepared for Steve's stock analysis earlier, so he can analyze the entire stock market over the last few years in a short execution time. As refactoring is a key part of the coding process, it will help the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 


## Results
> Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. The analysis is well described with screenshots and code





## Summary 
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
