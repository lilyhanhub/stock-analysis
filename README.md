# Stock Analysis with Excel VBA

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code for Steve to analyze the performance of certain stocks in the years 2017-2018, and to provide his parents with some insight if the stocks are worth investing. There was a similar code completed earlier. Now the goal for this round is to increase the efficiency of the original code.

The raw dataset comes with two worksheets of 12 stocks spanning two consecutive years. Each stock information consists of a ticker value, date, daily opening/closing/adjusted closing price, the highest/lowest price, and the volume of daily transactons. The goal is to create a new worksheet called "All Stocks Analysis" looping through all of the tickers, and to find the total daily volume and yearly return rate for each stock. 
The dataset can be found here: [VBA_Challenge](/VBA_Challenge.xlms)

## Results
> Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. The analysis is well described with screenshots and code





## Summary 
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
